Ex 1: Create Order MS running on  port 9012 , payment MS should run on port 9011.

Payment MS should have orderID and paymentStatus boolan. Now when the Post call for order is made then do the following:

Set order status =“I”
Make a call to the payment MS passing required data
If the call is successful (i.e if it returns http status code 200)  then update the order status to be “P” else (exception case also ) update the status to be “C”.

int id; 
String orderNumber; 
double orderValue; 
String orderStatus;
