Ex1: You are travelling by Air. For that you need to go through following processes inside a class called AirTravelProcess. 
checkIn
collectBoardingPass
doSecurityCheck
doBoarding

Using aop you implement an advice called showPhotoId before checkIn
Another advice showBoardingPass -> before secuirity check and before boarding. Put theses two advices in a  single aspect called AirTravelAspect   

During checkIn process you can encounter an exception called NoSeatAvailableException and handle it through an AfterThrowing advice.


void checkIn(Boolean flag) throws NoSeatAvailableException

 try
checkIn(false) -> true print check in successful if it is false throw NoSeatAvailableException
collectBoardingPass()
doSecurityCheck()
doBoarding()
}catch(Exception ex
{}
